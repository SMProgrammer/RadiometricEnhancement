This program is for applying two types of radiometric enhancements, histogram equalization and matching, to change or damage detection datasets. 
It allows for entire datasets to be enhanced at once and can produce graphs showing the enhancement process with the histograms and cumulative histograms of the images.

A user can select to use two images at a time to create enhanced images which can be saved to a file and graphs made,
or a user can create enhanced images for entire folders of images. 
In the case of enhancing two images, a new image can be saved to a desired location by indicating the file path and the name of the new image with the extension,
with the default location being where the program was run.
The program is designed for 8 bit jpg, png, or TIF images.

This program can be run in most Python IDEs, with the following packages installed: tkinter, numpy, matplotlib, and PIL

The graphical user interface is shown below:

An example of the graphs produced for matching is shown below.
